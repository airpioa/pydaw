# **PyDAW** - Python Digital Audio Workstation

**PyDAW** is a lightweight, feature-rich Digital Audio Workstation built in Python. It integrates several powerful features, such as:

- **Virtual Instruments** & **VST Plugin** Support
- **MIDI Sequencing** & **MIDI Instrument Integration**
- **ChucK Integration** for real-time audio synthesis and processing
- **PyQt6** for building a modern, customizable user interface

This project allows users to create, manipulate, and produce audio in a simple yet powerful DAW environment.

## **Features**

- **Workspace Management**: Easily create, open, and manage workspaces with MIDI tracks, instruments, and audio files.
- **MIDI Sequencer**: Record, edit, and play MIDI sequences within the workspace.
- **Virtual Instruments**: Support for virtual instruments and VST plugins.
- **ChucK Integration**: Real-time synthesis and processing capabilities via **ChucK** for sound generation, manipulation, and more.
- **Multi-platform**: Built to run on **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows**.

## **Building PyDAW**

Once **ChucK** is compiled, you can bundle **PyDAW** with **PyInstaller**.

1. Install **PyInstaller**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. Generate the spec file for PyInstaller:
   ```bash
   pyi-makespec --onefile pydaw.py
   ```

3. Modify the spec file to include **ChucK** binary (update the `binaries` section to point to the compiled **ChucK** binary).

4. Build the **PyDAW** application with **ChucK** bundled:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile pydaw.spec
   ```

5. Distribute your **PyDAW** application for your platform.

## **Running PyDAW**

1. **Linux**:
   - After building the application, distribute as a `.tar.gz` or `.deb` package.

2. **macOS**:
   - Build using **py2app** to create a macOS application bundle:
     ```bash
     python setup.py py2app
     ```

3. **Windows**:
   - Use **PyInstaller** to generate a `.exe` file and package it using **Inno Setup** or **NSIS** for distribution.

## **Usage**

1. **Create a New Workspace**: You can create a new workspace where you'll manage your MIDI tracks, instruments, and effects. The workspace is stored as a folder containing all necessary files and a manifest.

2. **Open an Existing Workspace**: Open an existing workspace and start working on your audio and MIDI production.

3. **Add Virtual Instruments and Effects**: PyDAW supports adding virtual instruments and VST plugins directly into your workspace.

4. **MIDI Sequencing**: Sequence and manipulate MIDI tracks. You can edit them, add new notes, and even use external MIDI controllers.

5. **ChucK Integration**: For sound synthesis, you can integrate **ChucK** scripts. This enables powerful real-time audio synthesis and manipulation.

---

## **ChucK Integration**

PyDAW integrates **ChucK** for real-time audio synthesis. It allows you to run **ChucK** scripts within your workspace, giving you access to generative sound, music, and real-time audio processing. 

To use **ChucK** in your workspace, simply add a **ChucK** script file in the workspaceâ€™s manifest. PyDAW will execute the script through the bundled **ChucK** binary.
